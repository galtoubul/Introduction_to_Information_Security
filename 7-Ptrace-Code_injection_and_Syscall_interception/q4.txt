q4.c:
    There are comments in the file itself.
    My code workflow (at the child process):
    1. Attach to the antivirus process
    2. Wait for a syscall
    3. If it is a read syscall (eax=0x03) then change size (edx) to 0.
       Go back to 2.
    I modified ecx in case of a read syscalls in both PTRACE_SYSCALL
    since we can't be sure in which point the malware will start
    the ptrace. Thus, it might be that the first one will catch a
    syscall immediately after it exits.

q4.py:
    There are comments in the file itself, and I used the same logic
    as in the previous questions.
