I found the GOT adddress by running:
objdump -M intel -d binaries/antivirus | grep -a10 check_if_virus

Then I got this output:
08048600 <check_if_virus@plt>:
 8048600:	ff 25 20 a0 04 08    	jmp    DWORD PTR ds:0x804a020
 8048606:	68 28 00 00 00       	push   0x28
 804860b:	e9 90 ff ff ff       	jmp    80485a0 <.plt>

As we learned at the recitation, the GOT address of check_if_virus
is 0x804a020.
The alternative I chose is check_if_live_patch, since it has the same signature
and the patch_hashes it scans doesn't contain any of invalid_hashes.
I found its address the same way as I found check_if_virus's address at q2.
