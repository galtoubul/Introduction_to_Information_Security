The vulnerability is that is strcat doesn't check for the size of the copied data
(unlinke strncat which is safer).
We can exploit it by noticing that buff and auth are close enough
(buff[20] = auth's msB), so we can change auth value even if the password isn't
correct. We just have to make sure that auth == 0x01 and by that we will pass
check_password. Since we use little endian, then auth's msB is actualy its lsB,
so we need exactly 10B for doing so (which is the max length for a password).
