In order to brute force the cipher we have to generate all possible 
keys and use each one of them to decrypt the cipher using the
function we coded at B.
Each decryption we will get will be scored by the function we coded at C
and the decryption with the biggest score will be the result.
Since the key will be only 2B long it will give us 65536 different
decryptions we will have to compare.
