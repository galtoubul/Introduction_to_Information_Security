Given a message M:
This time, instead of fixing the signature (M[1]) I chose to fix
the message to fit the given signature by adding an extra byte at
place M[0] + 2 (the end of checking/xoring zone)
I chose the byte in accordance to this calculation:
Given a signature - s, a cuurent xor value - curr_sign,
such that: s != curr_sign, I had to find x,
such that: x xor curr_sign == s
By xoring both sides with curr_sign we get:
(x xor curr_sign) xor curr_sign == s xor curr_sign
-> x xor 0 == s xor curr_sign -> x == s xor curr_sign
So, I inserted s xor curr_sign
