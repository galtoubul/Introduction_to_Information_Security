In order to patch the required changes I used 2 deadzone of nops.
The bigger starts at: 080485cd
The smaller starts at: 08048633
The locataion of the bigger isn't good for inserting our change since at that
point we havn't read the file yet and the desired place is after a succesful
line reading. Fortunately, we have the smaller dead zone execatly there.
So, I made a jump from this point to the big dead zone.
There, I checked that the line starts with #!.
If it does, I pushed the rest of the line to stack, called system()
and jumped back to perform a new line reading.
OW, I continued at a rgular execution (just printing).
