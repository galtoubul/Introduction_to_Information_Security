I used the same method for finding love as in part a.
In order to find encrypted data I decoded the raw part of the packet,
while ignoring decoding errors since it makes sense that there will be some
bytes that can't be decoded due to the encryption.
Than I used the shannon_entropy supplied function to find the entropy level
of the data.
