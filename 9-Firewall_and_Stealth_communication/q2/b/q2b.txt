I generated the key and the IV using Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes
(copied key from terminal after creating it)
I chose to use CBC mode since it's better then ECB mode and seems
to be good enough for our needs.
I used PKCS7 padding as suggested
Did encryption, decryption and padding in according to the documentations:
