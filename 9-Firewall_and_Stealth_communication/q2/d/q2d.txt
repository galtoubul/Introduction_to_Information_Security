Winston's algorithm when trying to send a sentence to Juila:
1. Create a string by concatenating 8-bits representation of the sentence's charactars
2. Create a list of the decimal representations of each 3-bits binary number from
   the string that was created in 1.
3. Send each element from the above list as reserved bits of a packet.
   The number of packets to send to Julia will be the length of the above list.
   Thus, the ACK number will be the length of the above list miuns 1 (since SEQ numbers
   will start from 0).

Juila's algorithm when trying to recieve a sentence from Winston:
1. For each packet from Winston's sending port:
    1.1. Let x be the ACK number
    1.2. If we didn't get x different SEQ numbers:
        1.2.1. Save the packet's reserved bits (ordered by SEQ numbers)
    1.3. Build a string by concatenating 3-bits representation of the packets' reserved bits
    1.4. Build a string by concatenating characters representation of each 8-bits from
         the above string
2. The sentence from Winston is the string from 1.4.
