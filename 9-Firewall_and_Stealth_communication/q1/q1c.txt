The valnerability in the firewall design that makes him susceptible to a DoS attack
is that an attacker may cause the firewall to block IP addresses of legitmate hosts
by sending more than 15 SYN packets in a 60 seconds window with their IP address.
So, let's say that IP address A is a legitmate host that should be able to send
packets over the firewall and the attacker wants to prevent the firewall from giving
service to this host, so he can block its IP with more than 15 SYN packets in a 60
seconds window.
