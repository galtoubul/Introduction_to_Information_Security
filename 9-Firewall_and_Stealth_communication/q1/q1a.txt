generate_syn_packets:
    Created packets with SYN flag in order to try to initialize
    a 3-way-handshake.

analyze_scan:
    If we got answered then the port is open or closed.
    If it is closed then we will probably get ACK-RST flags.
    Thus, RST flag will be on.
    If it is open then we will get SYN-ACK flags.
    Thus, these are the only flags that will be on.
    if we didn't get any answer then the firewall has filtered us.

The resaon for it being called stealth SYN scan is that in a real stealth
SYN scan a RST is being sent as well and thus closing the half open connection
that was made. By doing so it is attracting less attention than if it 
wouldn't do that and might cause a SYN flood DoS.
