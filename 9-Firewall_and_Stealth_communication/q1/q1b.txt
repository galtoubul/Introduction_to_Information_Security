The general idea of my solution:
I chose to use a dictionary from ip to insertion times.
Every time it gets bigger than 20 entries I update it
(remove all ips that their latest insertion time was before more than 60 seconds)
When a new SYN packet from a non-blocked ip arrives:
I'm adding it to the dictionary/updating its insertion times list
(remove all insertion times that waren't in the last 60 seconds)
When the size of an ip's list in the dictionary gets bigger than 15 than 
I block it by adding a new rule to DROP all the packets from this IP.
