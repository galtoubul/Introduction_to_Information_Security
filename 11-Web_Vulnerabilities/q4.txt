The vulnerability is that there isn't a good enough escaping/blacklisting in the
input for SQL queries, such as the one that is related to renaming.
The exploit is SQL injection.
The attack works since I used /rename in the following way:
I passed as new_name: closing ' for the input for full_name and gave a false
condition so that no renaming has happened. Instead I continued the SQL query
with my own query to update the password of bob to 1234 (saved the hash of it
in the DB using sha1). Then I used -- in the end to comment the following:
' WHERE user_id = 'bob'
