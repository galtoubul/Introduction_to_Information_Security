The vulnerability is that there isn't a validation for validating that the
name of a new channel doesn't contain a script element.
Thus, the exploit I chose is creating a new channel with a name that contains
a script for creating a new post in #general-spam with "Good Morning!" text,
and then refreshing the messages so that the message will be shown (I used
the code from PostMessage).
The attack works since the channels' list is identicall for all users and is being 
loaded from the DB at each $(document).ready.
