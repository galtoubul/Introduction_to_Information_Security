The vulnerability is that slack-off didn't implement CSRF tokens and thus it processes
requests even if their origin isn't from slack-off.
The exploit I used is simply sending a post request with the proper data in 
accordance to the question requirements (channel, message, file).
It works since the the request is being sent using the user's cookies and since 
slack off didn't implement CSRF tokens so it processes the request.
