The flow of opening the website for a client:
1. login_required calls validate_login with the client's 'login' cookie
2. validate_login decodes the cookie using base64
3. validate_login checks if the DB contains the decoded cookie as a user name
4. If it does the client will be able to connect to the website without entering any username/password
Thus, all we need to do is to edit the 'login' cookie to contain 'edward' at base64 (= ZWR3YXJk)
We can calculate 'edwards' base64 using one of the following:
1. JS     - btoa('edward')
2. Python - base64.b64encode('edward'.encode()).decode()
