When a JSON has the same key more than once than the value of the last one is going
to be used. Using this fact, I created a string at the same format as a JSON dump
with 2 "command" keys so that when the JSON will be loaded the second
entry will override the first one. The flaw is that run.pu uses json.load() when
validating and read() when executing. So, the data we send will be in JSON format at
validation and as a string at execution. So, it will make the validation on the value
of the second key which is the one that matches the signature and the value of the first
one is the one that contains our "echo hacked". regex.match() catches the first
occurance so the value of the first key will be used at execution.
