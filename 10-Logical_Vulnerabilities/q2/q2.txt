pickle.loads can use reduce in order to serialize the pickled object
Moreover, when reduce returns a tuple than the first element is a callable
object and the second is a tuple of arguments for the callable object, so I used
it to pass os.system as the callable object and 'echo hacked' as the argument.
By doing so, when pickle.loads will serialize the object it will run the 
callable object (os.system) with its args ('echo hacked')
