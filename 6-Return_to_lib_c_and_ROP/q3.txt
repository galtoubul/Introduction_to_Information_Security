I overriden the return address with gadgets that mov ecx (!= 0)
to the address of AUTH.
In more details, the instructions of my gadgets:
pop eax -> eax's value will be AUTH's address, since I placed its address just 
above this command on stack
mov DWORD PTR [eax], ecx -> I found out the ecx isn't 0 (it's value is 0x32) 
just before calling ret at check_password. So, when jumping back to main
and checking if auth isn't 0 we will get true, and thus "Victory!" will be printed.
I found the original ra of check_password and placed it as the last instruction,
so that the program will get to main eventually.
