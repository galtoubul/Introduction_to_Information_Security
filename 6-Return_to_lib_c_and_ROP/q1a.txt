The vulnerability is in check_password function.
It calls decode_base64 which inserts the decoded argv[1] to buff[11].
buff[11] address          =   0xbfffdf85
return address address    =   0xbfffe00c
0xbfffe00c - 0xbfffdf85   =   135
Thus, by passing a 139 bytes string as input we can override
the return address and crash the program.
