As a continue to q1b explenation..
We want that after system finishes execution it will jump to exit.
Thus, I overriden system's ra with exit's address.
When the program will jump to exit, the stack will look like this:
0xbfffe018  |   exit's arg
0xbfffe014  |   system's arg
0xbfffe010  |   system's ra = exit's address  
0xbfffe00c  |   system's address
Thus, I overriden exit's arg with 0x42.
