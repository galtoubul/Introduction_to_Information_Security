When check_password is going to finish execution it will RET.
check_password's ra address = 0xbfffe00c
Thus, I overriden its ra with system address.
When the program will jump to system, the stack will look like this:
0xbfffe014  |   system's arg
0xbfffe010  |   system's ra
0xbfffe00c  |   system's address
Thus, I overriden system's arg with "/bin/sh" address.
