Using the code from q1 I filtered only the packets that are
a login request to our WEBSITE. For each of those I built a new packet.
I made a "reversed" packet regarding the ip and tcp port such that
new source tcp port/ip = old destination tcp port/ip and vice versa
The ack# of the response packet should be the seq# of the request packet + 
length of the request itself (Raw part of the packet)
The reason for adding the length of the request itself is that seq# 
doesn't include it and we want to acknowledgment the data till the latest
point of the stream.
The seq# of the response packet should be the ack# of the request packet
I turned on Ack flag since this is an acknowledgment of the request packet
I turned on Push flag in order to send the response immediatly and before 
the response with the data from the course WEBSITE
I turned on the Fin flag to close the connection in according the execise
requirements.
