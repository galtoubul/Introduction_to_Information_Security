is_packet_to_original_gateway:
    When a packet is meant to reach the GW it must have its MAC address as
    destination MAC address eventually, while the packet IP may be the IP 
    of another host. Thus, I checked that the packet had the MAC address
    of the GW as destination MAC address and that its source MAC address
    wasn't our MAC address in order to make sure we don't filter packets
    sent by us.

create_poison:
    I have created an ARP response to the sender of the victim packet (thus,
    using its ip as pdst = ip destination).
    In this response I "told" him:
    "Hi! ip psrc has MAC address hwdst"
    where psrc is the GW IP and hwdst is our MAC address.

is_stolen_packet:
    If this packet is stolen by our ARP poisoning then it's a packet which
    its destination isn't us. Thus, its ip address isn't our ip address.
    But, this packet reach us anyway since it has our MAC address.
    The reason for that is that this packet was meant to be routed by the GW
    but the arp table contains our MAC address as the GW MAC Address.
