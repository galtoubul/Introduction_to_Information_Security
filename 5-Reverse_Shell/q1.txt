The vulnerability is in handle_connection function.
When it is called by serve with a socket descriptor it reads "size" bytes into 1024b size buffer.
The problem is that "size" can be any unsigned int, thus we exploit it by overflowing 
buff so that it will override the return address.

The return address starts at 0xbfffe19c.
buff starts at 0xbfffdd8c.
0xbfffe19c - 0xbfffdd8c = 1040 (10)
So, by passing a 1044b payload we can override the return address and crash the program.
(because we have to pass a null terminated string we will pass 1045b string in which
bytes 1040 - 1044 will be the desired return address and byte 1045 will be \0)
