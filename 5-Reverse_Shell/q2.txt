shellcode.asm:
    Notes in the file
    In the begging of the file I have alligned the stack pointer and 
    substracketed 512 Bytes for:
    local variables of shellcode.asm, the shellcode itself
    ,the decoder (relevant for the next question) and some spare space.

get_payload:
    Tried to jump to the middle of the nop slide (since I don't have 
    any assumptions about the stack movement direction) according to:
    starting point of the shellcode  = 0xbfffe12f
    starting point of buff           = 0xbfffdd8c
    Thus, nop slide size is 0xbfffe12f - 0xbfffdd8c = 0x3a3 bytes
    So, we should jump to: 0xbfffdd8c + (0x3a3 / 2) ~=  0xbfffdf5d
    I jumped to 0xbfffdf60
    I overriden conn with 0x07 which shouldn't close any fd
